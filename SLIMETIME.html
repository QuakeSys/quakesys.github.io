        <p>The United States has fractured into dozens of constantly warring statelets.<br>
            A new wave of false communist aesthetics have gripped liberal nations.<br>
            Corporations continue to act with even less oversight than ever.<br>
            Death itself has been conquered - but only in wealthy places.<br>
            This is all set dressing for one day in the life of one trans woman - Kyle T. Orlanski. On a sleepless night, she receives a phone call from a clinic in her home city of Vancouver, Canada. Someone that she's supposed to know was recently recombinated, and needs help finding his home. With nothing better to do, and finally with a reason to quit wallowing, she drives off to have one of the most terrible days of her life.<br>
            It's SLIME TIME.<br>
            <br>
            SLIME TIME is a post-queer post-human traumapunk novella written by a disabled transgender woman. It's about queer lives, sex-as-identity, the bounds of society, and how familiarly weird the future might be, all through the eyes of one single disaffected transfem burnout. This is not a book for the faint of heart, but it is for those who want a book steeped in grunge and grime, with heavy themes and excellent writing, that looks into how we often find community through weird sex.
